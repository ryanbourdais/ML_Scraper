Hey so this project includes:
- LSU_Scraper.py, a web scraper that scraped data from ESPN.com
- algos.py, where all the ML algorithms are written
- ESPN Data.xlsx, where data was manually scraped from ESPN.com

-To use this project, you will need the pandas package, matplotlib and sklearn packages.
-Run algos.py.
-The output will be the W/L ratio predicted by each ML algorithm we used, followed by the accuracy.
-Followed by a visualization of the algorithms predictions.
-The models we used were: Decision Tree, Naive-Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors.
